    "The energy capital, nature, mountains in addtion to the fourth highest population density makes the city of Calgary an attractive place for a buisness. However for newcomers, immigrants and even people from the Eastern provinces of Canada could be a big challnege to select the best neighbourhood to set up the buisness to have the maximum rate of return specifically in this uncerstain and tough economic times. This study aims to answer most of the questions to select the best neighrbourhood in Calgary to set up spefically a grocery store. The study would use the negihbourhood cordinates, population density in each neighbourhood and four square API to get the existing grocery store in each neighbourhood. The study is designed in particular for an investor who is interested to start up an asian grocery store in Calgary and have not been to Calgary before. It is belived that this study along with the economic analysis would help to optimize the location for the investor. \n"

Machine learning algorithms will be applied including K-Means to cluster the neighbourhood. Then simple 2D plots are generated to see the population density within various neighrbourhood and ranking is done based on the author knowledge to rank the neighbourhood first within each cluster and then on global level to start the buisness.\n",
